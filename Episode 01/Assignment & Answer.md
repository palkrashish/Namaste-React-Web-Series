<summary><b>Que 2 : - </b> What is cossorigin ?</summary>
The crossorigin attribute sets the mode of the request to an HTTP CORS Request. A cross-origin request is a request for a resource (e.g. style sheets, iframes, images, fonts, or scripts) from another domain.
CORS is used to manage cross-origin requests. <b>CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing,</b> and is a mechanism that allows resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside their own domain.

```<script
  src="https://example.com/example-framework.js"
